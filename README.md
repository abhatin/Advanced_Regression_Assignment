# Advanced_Regression_Assignment
## Problem Statement
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## Key Objectives
The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and how well those variables describe the price of a house.
- Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## Business Goal
- To model the price of houses with the available independent variables.
- To be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
- To formulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.
- Way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Observations

#### Optimal Value of Alpha for Ridge: 0.3
#### Optimal Value of Alpha for Lasso: 0.0001 

Top 5 predictor values are 
- TotalBsmtSF

- Functional_Sev


## Technologies Used
Python Libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodel, linear regression, Ridge and Lasso Regularization
